                <h3 id="latehomeworkpolicy">Late homework policy</h3>

                <p>Homework submitted late without permission will be penalized according to the following formula: (Penalized score) = (Your raw score) * (1 - 0.1 * (# of days past deadline))</p>

                <p>This formula will apply for up to three days, after which the homework will not be accepted and you will receive a grade of zero. Avoid invoking these penalties by starting early and seeking extra help. </p>

                <h3 id="gradingscale">Grading scale</h3>


                <ul>

                <h3 id="principles">Principles of Community</h3>

                <p>Because the course will include in-class discussions, we will adhere to Virginia Tech's <a href="http://inclusive.vt.edu/vtpoc0.html">Principles of Community</a>. The first two principles are most relevant:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding.</li>
                    <li>We affirm the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely. We encourage open expression within a climate of civility, sensitivity, and mutual respect.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The remaining principles are also important and we will take them seriously as a class.</p>
